## Introduction

The Indian Supreme Court delivers numerous judgments that shape the country's legal landscape. However, systematic analysis to uncover underlying patterns and trends is lacking. Verdict Insight aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analytical tool to process and analyze these judgments.

## Features

- **Text Extraction and Preprocessing**: Extract and clean text from PDF and HTML judgments.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identify common themes and topics within the judgments.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment expressed in the judgments.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract and categorize entities such as judges, petitioners, respondents, and legal terms.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis on metadata such as case durations, decision outcomes, and frequency of case types.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize insights with interactive charts, timelines, and word clouds.
